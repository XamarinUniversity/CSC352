        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>5 minutes</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>
            The goal of this lab is to increase our performance by providing a more fine-grained locking approach to our cats. Rather than locking the entire dining room, we will lock the sensors the cat needs - in this way, the cats won't all be in competition with each other, just with the cats to either side which should allow them to eat more bites each second.
        </p>

        <h2>Required assets</h2>
        <p>
            You will be continuing with the prior exercise's code in this lab.
            The provided <strong>Exercise 3</strong> folder contains a sub-folder named <strong>Completed</strong> with a solution you can use to check your work. 
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            We will need to replace our current <code>static</code> lock with a finer grained lock. In this case, we will use the sensor objects we need to touch.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Remove the <code>guard</code> lock you have been using to this point.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the <code>firstSensor</code> and <code>secondSensor</code> fields provided to cat - lock <code>firstSensor</code> first, check the sensor, and if succesful, lock the <code>secondSensor</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Run the application to see if it improves the bites-per-second displayed next to each cat.
            </li>
        </ol>

                if (secondSensor.StepOnSensor(this))
                {
                    TakeABite();
                    secondSensor.LeaveBowl(this);
                }
            }
            firstSensor.LeaveBowl(this);
        }

            The application may behave improperly at this point - in fact, it's very likely that you will cause the application to freeze and stop responding. Do a little diagnosis if this happens and see if you can figure out what's causing the issue. We'll then regroup and talk about why this is happening.
        </div>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            In this exercise you made the locking more fine-grained to provide better scalability and allow multiple cats to eat at the same time as long as they aren't next to each other.
